This repo contains business logic and scripts for initializing and managing new crypto miners. It spawns a local server to manage initialization and pool switching for various miners (Goldshell, Antminer, etc.). This software will ultimately become a full-fledge farm management application. As features, closer to the firmware, are developed the software will be able to support more complex queries and actions, as opposed to being limited by 3rd-party APIs or even the firmware's APIs.
